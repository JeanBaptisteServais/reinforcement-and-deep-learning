Dk learns to avoid missiles which change with each turn (not a good accuracy)

at each turn the missiles change and he learns the new configuration a bit like in sport where we must visualize each movement and adapt to the movement of a ball or a catch (or not at all it's just a new training with a new configuration)

For example we know all problem of an envrionement and doom need to find in an express time a new solution of the problem

In big training during the game
